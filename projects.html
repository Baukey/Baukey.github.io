        <p>
            During my study abroad in New Zealand, our group of American students went to a part of 
            Christchurch, NZ that was devastated by earthquakes in 2011. This area was uninhabitable 
            for quite some time, but we built a bike park for local kids to ride and have some fun.

            This picture is dedicated to all the coding projects I have done thus far, and to represent the difficulty of
            some of those projects, this picture shows how one would code "Hello World" in Heskell. Do you think you could 
            learn Heskell?
